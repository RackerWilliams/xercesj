Build Instructions:

To build Xerces Java on Windows, you need a copy of Cygnus's Cygwin.
See http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin. Once Cygwin is installed,
or if you're on unix, all you need to do is then to go to the top of
the Xerces Java tree and type 'make'.

If you're using JDK 1.1 and want to build the documentation you need
to specify where the JDK 1.2 java and javadoc programs are by setting
the variable JDK12BIN, either in your environment or simply when
calling make with something like:

	make JDK12BIN="<pathToJDK12>"
