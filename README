			Xerces Java Build Instructions

** On Windows:

First, you need a copy of Cygnus's Cygwin.
See http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin.

If your JDK is properly installed on your system, you do not need to set
any CLASSPATH to build Xerces. If you have one, make sure it does not end
with a '\' or it will cause the build to fail.

If you're using JDK 1.1 and want to build the documentation you then need
to specify where the JDK 1.2 java and javadoc programs are by setting
the variable JDK12BIN in your environment with something like:

    set JDK12BIN="C:/jdk1.2.2/bin"

Note the use of forward slashes! Depending on which version of make you are
using having blackshlashes there may cause the build to fail.

Then, if you're not using the Cygwin bash shell, you need to set the variable
MAKE_MODE in your environment like this:

    set MAKE_MODE=UNIX

Finally, from the top of the Xerces Java tree, run make.



** On Unix:

If your JDK is properly installed on your system, you do not need to set
any CLASSPATH to build Xerces.

If you're using JDK 1.1 and want to build the documentation you then need
to specify where the JDK 1.2 java and javadoc programs are by setting
the variable JDK12BIN in your environment with something like:

    set JDK12BIN "/usr/local/jdk-1.2.2/bin"

Then, from the top of the Xerces Java tree, run make.
