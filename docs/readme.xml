  <p>
   Welcome to the future! Xerces2 is the next generation of
   high performance, fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache
   Xerces family. This new version of Xerces introduces the
   Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for
   building parser components and configurations that is
   extremely modular and easy to program. 
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation 
   of XNI but other parser components, configurations, and parsers
   can be written using the Xerces Native Interface. For complete
   design and implementation documents, refer to the 
   <link idref='xni'>XNI Manual</link>.

 <s2 title='Changes from Previous Release'>
  <p>
   This is the first Xerces2 release to include support for validating
   XML documents against XML Schema grammars. The XML Schema validation 
   engine was completely redesigned and rewritten for Xerces2. Therefore,
   the XML Schema support in this release should be considered alpha.
  </p>
  <p>
   This release also introduces some changes to the Xerces Native
   Interface. The following list enumerates the important changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Filter interfaces were added to simplify the implementation and
    use of pipeline components that consume and produce document
    and DTD events.
   </li>
   <li>
    Getter methods were added to the <code>XMLParserConfiguration</code>
    interface to query the registered handlers, resolvers, etc.
   </li>
   <li>
    The <code>XMLDTDHandler#internalEntityDecl</code> method was
    modified to include the non-normalized literal value of the
    internal entity.
   </li>
   <li>
    The <code>XMLAttributes</code> interface was simplified by
    removing the methods relating to entities appearing in
    attribute values. The non-normalized attribute value in
    conjunction with the non-normalized value for internal entity
    declarations makes these methods unnecessary.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For a more complete list of changes, refer to the 
   <link idref='releases'>Release Information</link> page.
  </p>	      
 </s2>
 <s2 title='Changes from Xerces 1.x'>
  <p>
   Xerces2 is a nearly complete rewrite of the Xerces 1.x codebase
   in order to make the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to
   maintain. Applications using only the standard interfaces such as
   JAXP, DOM, and SAX should not see any differences.
  </p>
