	<s2 title="Introduction">
		<p>This package contains an implementation of the W3C XML 
		Schema Language, a recommendation of the Worldwide Web Consortium
        available in three parts:  
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLSchema-0">XML Schema:  Primer</jump>  and
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLSchema-1">XML Schema:  Structures</jump>  and
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLSchema-2">XML Schema:  Datatypes</jump>. 
        We consider this implementation to be complete except for the
        limitations cited below.  The implementation has been
        extensively tested and known problem areas are set out below.
        In this document we also discuss our interpretation of the
        specifications where it seems to us particularly likely that
        others might arrive at a different interpretation.
        Please read this document before using this package.

	<s2 title="Limitations">
        <ul>
            <li> Length, minLength, and maxLength facets are limited to the value 
            2147483647. Items larger than this limit will not be validated 
            correctly.</li>
            <li> The values of minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes are limited to
            the value 2147483647. Items larger than this limit will not be
            validated correctly.</li>
            <li> The values of minimum and maximum quantifiers in the pattern
            regular expressions are limited to the value 2147483647.
            Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly.</li>
            <li> The absolute values of the fraction portion of the second values
            in date/time datatypes are limited to the value 2147483647.
            Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly.
            i.e. 11.2147483648 is not supported as a second value. </li>
        </ul>
    </s2>
    <s2 title='Problem Areas/Known Bugs'>
        <ul>
            <li> For larger values of maxOccurs, an OutOfMemoryError may occur.
      	    The workaround for this problem, if your application permits it, 
      	    is to change the maxOccurs value to unbounded.</li>
        </ul>
    </s2>
	<s2 title="Other Notes">
        <p> As of version 2.2.1, it is hoped that Xerces-J will always 
        be able to parse the Schema for Schemas current at the time of the product's release.  As of version
        2.2.1, this implies inserting special logic to permit the presence of
        the built-in Schema datatypes in this particular schema; an
        issue has been raised with the Schema Working Group, in hopes the document
        will be modified so that the built-in types are no
        longer presented as global components.  Thus, anyone planning
        to rely on the Schema for Schemas should be aware that the
        possibility exists that a change of this sort might be made in the future.
