	<faq title="Swing?">
		<q>Which version of Swing is required?</q>
		<a> <p>This release uses Swing 1.1 (JFC 1.1). 
			Swing is only used by the sample programs and is not 
			required by the parser itself.</p>

	<faq title="Recompling?">
		<q>How do I recompile the source files?</q>
		<a> <p>To build &javaparsername; on Windows, you need a copy of Cygnus's Cygwin.
See <jump href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin</jump>.
Once Cygwin is installed, you need to set two environment variables.  Edit the batch file
BuildAll.bat to set these variables.  Execute BuildAll.bat, and then
set your classpath to point to the src and samples directories in the
&javaparsername; distribution.  You can then go to the top of the
&javaparsername; tree and type 'make'.  
</p>
<p>
To build &javaparsername; Java on UNIX, you need to set an environment
variable. Edit the shell script BuildAll to set this variables.  
Execute BuildAll, and then set your classpath to point to the src 
and samples directories in the &javaparsername; distribution.  You can then
go to the top of the &javaparsername; tree and type 'make'.

	<faq title="Regenerating?">
		<q>How do I regenerate the api documentation?</q>
		<a> <p>To regenerate the api documentation, you need to set up
your environment to build &javaparsername;.  Instead of typing 'make', you
type 'make apidocs'.

	<faq title="Visual Age?">
		<q>How do I import &javaparsername; into Visual Age for Java</q>
		<a> 		
		<ul>
          <li>Why does VisualAge for Java 2.0 report problems when I import the &javaparsername; parser?
			<br/>The current version of the &javaparsername; parser uses Swing 1.1, 
		  	while VisualAge for Java 2.0 comes with Swing 1.0.2. The free update for the 
            Professional version of VisualAge for Java 2.0 installs Swing 1.0.3. 
			The most important difference between Swing 1.0.2 - 1.0.3 and 1.1 is 
			the Java package was changed from com.sun.java.swing.* to javax.swing.*.
			<br/>To fix the errors, you must download the Java Foundation Classes 1.1 
			with Swing 1.1 from Sun's Java home page and import the &quot;swingall.jar&quot; 
			file into VisualAge for Java 2.0. The Swing 1.1 package can be found at 
            the following URL:
			<br/><jump href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html</jump>
			<br/>Refer to the VisualAge for Java 2.0 documentation for information about 
			how to import a JAR file into the repository and add that code to your workspace.
          </li>
          <li>Are there any other tips for importing the &javaparsername; parser into VisualAge 
		  	for Java 2.0?
			<br/>The most useful tip applies to *any* updated code that you import 
			into the VisualAge for Java 2.0 product. Before updating code, do the following:
            <br/>1. version the old code
			<br/>2. delete it from your workspace
			<br/>3. import the new code
            <br/>Deleting code from your workspace does not actually delete the code 
				permanently -- the versioned code is moved to the repository where it can be 
				retrieved later. Be aware, though, that removing code from your 
           		workspace will cause problems with all of the other classes that use that code. 
				VisualAge for Java 2.0 will flag them as errors but this situation is temporary. 
				When you import the new code, the errors found when deleting the old code will be fixed.
				<br/>If you are unsure as to how to perform any of these steps, refer to the VisualAge 
				for Java 2.0 documentation.

		<q>How do I get &javaparsername; to run on the Mac under MRJ?</q>
		<a> <p><em>Prerequisites</em> (available from 
			<jump href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">http://developer.apple.com/java/</jump>):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MRJ 2.1 (this is the most recent version of the JVM)</li>
          <li>MRJ SDK 2.1 (this is the most recent version of the Java developer tools)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Instructions </em>(other variations would work also):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the .tar.gz file containing &javaparsername;.</li>
          <li>Use Stuffit Expander(tm), Suntar, or some other Macintosh tool that
		  	<br/>supports the .tar.gz format to expand the downloaded file.</li>
          <li>JBindery, part of MRJ SDK 2.1, is used to create a double-clickable 
		  	Java application with the necessary configuration information built in. 
			It is analogous to writing a .bat or .sh script. </li>
          <li><em>To run the dom.DOMWriter example:</em></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Double click on JBindery to start it up.</li>
            <li>Click on the Classpath panel.</li>
            <li>Click on the &quot;Add .zip File&quot; button and add both the 
				&quot;Xerces-J.jar&quot; and &quot;Xerces-JSamples.jar&quot; files.</li>
            <li>Click on the Command panel.</li>
            <li>Enter &quot;dom.DOMWriter&quot; as the Class name. Enter 
				&quot;data/personal.xml&quot; in the Optional parameters box.</li>
            <li>Click on Save Settings button, pick a name such as &quot;Run dom.DOMWriter&quot; 
				for the file, and <em>be sure</em> that &quot;Save as Application&quot; 
				is selected (this is the default) and save the file.</li>
            <li>Quit JBindery.</li>
            <li>You can now double click on the file you created in step f to run the XJParse example.</li>
          </ol>

	<faq title="Visual Cafe Error?">
		<q>Why do I get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the Symantec Visual Cafe debugger?</q>
		<a> <p>Visual Cafe's debugger is set to trap <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>'s by 
        	default. &javaparsername; uses <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> internally to signal 
			exceptional, but not erroneous conditions. In order to run &javaparsername;2 inside 
       		Visual Cafe's debugger, you need to turn off the trapping of these 
			exceptions.</p>
			<p><em>To do this:</em></p>
        	<ol>
          		<li>Select the &quot;Options&quot; item in the "Project" menu.</li>
          		<li>Select the &quot;Debugger&quot; tab in the dialog which appears.</li>
          		<li>Select &quot;Exceptions&quot; from the popup menu.</li>
          		<li>Remove the check from the checkbox for <code>java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</li>
        	</ol>
