		<p>The IteratorView is an interactive UI sample that displays the DOM tree. It
		shows the progress of the iteration by moving the selection within the DOM tree.
		Buttons act as a control panel, allowing the user to interactively iterate through
		the tree,  remove nodes, add nodes, and view the results immediately in the tree.</p>
		<p>The IteratorView uses an example filter, NameNodeFilter, that can be controlled
		from the UI and a DOMTreeFull class that displays the full DOM tree with all
		the nodes.</p>

		<p>The controls are called through to to the corresponding iterator function. If you
		are familiar with  the DOM Level 2 Traversal specification, these controls are
		fairly easy to understand</p>

		<s3 title="Iterator Group">
		<ul>
			<li>Next - calls the next() functions and selects the next node in the tree.</li>
			<li>Previous - calls the previous() function a and selects the previous node in
     		the tree.</li>
		</ul>
		</s3>
		<s3 title="Selected Node Group">
     	<ul>
			<li>remove - remove the selected Node and update the DOM tree. You
    		 must press an iterator button to see next or  previous node selection. </li>
     		<li>add - add a text node, to see the results of adding a node on the iterator.
     		position. Again you must first press next or previous </li>

		<s3 title="Iterator Settings Group">
     	<ul>
			<li>createNodeIterator - calls the factory method to create a new iterator 
   			with the corresponding whatToShow and NodenameFilter settings.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The root is set to be the root of the document, so it 
					starts at the top level each time.</li>
				</ul>
			 
			<li>whatToShow - you can singly or multiply select values and the 
			iterator is constrained to showing these types.</li>
			<li>NodeNameFilter - An empty string is converted to null and given 
			to the NodeNameFilter class.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>An empty string matches all nodes.</li>
					<li>A non-empty string is forced to match node names.</li>
				</ul>
