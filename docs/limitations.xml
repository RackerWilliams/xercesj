    Due to a transcoding bug in the Sun JDK's (1.1.6, 1.1.7, 1.1.8, 1.2)
    handling of EBCDIC data (specifically, end of line characters), you 
    must use IBM's JDK 1.1.6, if you want to use EBCDIC support. The IBM 
    JDK has the bug fixed.  We don't know when the bug fix will get into 
    the Sun JDKs.
