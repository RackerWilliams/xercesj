/**
 * This class is a container for parser settings that relate to 
 * security, or more specifically, it is intended to be used to prevent denial-of-service 
 * attacks from being launched against a system running Xerces.  
 * Any component that is aware of a denial-of-service attack that can arise
 * from its processing of a certain kind of document may query its Component Manager
 * for the property (http://apache.org/xml/properties/security-manager) 
 * whose value will be an instance of this class.  
 * If no value has been set for the property, the component should proceed in the "usual" (spec-compliant)
 * manner.  If a value has been set, then it must be the case that the component in
 * question needs to know what method of this class to query.  This class
 * will provide defaults for all known security issues, but will also provide
 * setters so that those values can be tailored by applications that care.
