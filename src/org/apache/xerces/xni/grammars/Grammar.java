package org.apache.xerces.xni.grammars;

/**
 * A generic grammar for use in validating XML documents. The Grammar
 * object stores the validation information in a compiled form. Specific
 * subclasses extend this class and "populate" the grammar by compiling 
 * the specific syntax (DTD, Schema, etc) into the data structures used
 * by this object.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> The Grammar object is not useful as a generic 
 * grammar access or query object. In other words, you cannot round-trip 
 * specific grammar syntaxes with the compiled grammar information in 
 * the Grammar object. You <em>can</em> create equivalent validation
 * rules in your choice of grammar syntax but there is no guarantee that
 * the input and output will be the same.
 * 
 * <p> Right now, this class is largely a shell; eventually, 
 * it will be enriched by having more expressive methods added. </p>
 * will be moved from dtd.Grammar here.
