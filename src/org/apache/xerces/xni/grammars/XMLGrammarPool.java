package org.apache.xerces.xni.grammars;

/*
 * <p> This interface specifies how the parser and the application
 * interact with respect to Grammar objects that the application
 * possesses--either by having precompiled them or by having stored them
 * from a previous validation of an instance document.  It makes no
 * assumptions about the kind of Grammar involved, or about how the
 * application's storage mechanism works.</p>
 *
 * <p>The interaction works as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a validator considers a document, it is expected to request
 * grammars of the type it can handle from this object using the
 * <code>retrieveInitialGrammarSet</code> method. </li>
 * <li>If it requires a grammar
 * not in this set, it will request it from this Object using the
 * <code>retrieveGrammar</code> method.  </li>
 * <li> After successfully validating an
 * instance, the validator should make any new grammars it has compiled
 * available to this object using the <code>cacheGrammars</code>
 * method; for ease of implementation it may make other Grammars it holds references to as well (i.e., 
 * it may return some grammars that were retrieved from the GrammarPool in earlier operations). </li> </ul> </p>
