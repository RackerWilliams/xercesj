/**
 * Represents a parser configuration. The parser configuration maintains
 * a table of recognized features and properties, assembles components
 * for the parsing pipeline, and is responsible for initiating parsing
 * of an XML document.
 * <p>
 * By separating the configuration of a parser from the specific parser
 * instance, applications can create new configurations and re-use the
 * existing parser components and external API generators (e.g. the
 * DOMParser and SAXParser).
 * <p>
 * The internals of any specific parser configuration instance are hidden.
 * Therefore, each configuration may implement the parsing mechanism any
 * way necessary. However, the parser configuration should follow these
 * guidelines:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>
 *   Call the <code>reset</code> method on each component before parsing.
 *   This is only required if the configuration is re-using existing
 *   components that conform to the <code>XMLComponent</code> interface.
 *   If the configuration uses all custom parts, then it is free to 
 *   implement everything as it sees fit as long as it follows the
 *   other guidelines.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   Call the <code>setFeature</code> and <code>setProperty</code> method
 *   on each component during parsing to propagate features and properties
 *   that have changed. This is only required if the configuration is
 *   re-using existing components that conform to the <code>XMLComponent</code>
 *   interface. If the configuration uses all custom parts, then it is free
 *   to implement everything as it sees fit as long as it follows the other
 *   guidelines.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   Pass the same unique String references for all symbols that are
 *   propagated to the registered handlers. Symbols include, but may not
 *   be limited to, the names of elements and attributes (including their
 *   uri, prefix, and localpart). This is suggested but not an absolute 
 *   must. However, the standard parser components may require access to 
 *   the same symbol table for creation of unique symbol references to be
 *   propagated in the XNI pipeline.
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
