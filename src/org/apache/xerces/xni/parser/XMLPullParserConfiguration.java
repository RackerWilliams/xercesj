/**
 * Represents a parser configuration that can be used as the 
 * configuration for a "pull" parser. A pull parser allows the
 * application to drive the parser instead of having document
 * information events "pushed" to the registered handlers.
 * <p>
 * A pull parser using this type of configuration first calls
 * the <code>setInputSource</code> method. After the input
 * source is set, the pull parser repeatedly calls the
 * <code>parse(boolean):boolean</code> method. This method 
 * returns a value of true if there is more to parse in the
 * document.
 * <p>
 * Calling the <code>parse(XMLInputSource)</code> is equivalent
 * to setting the input source and calling the 
 * <code>parse(boolean):boolean</code> method with a "complete" 
 * value of <code>true</code>.
