/**
 * This class is used as a structure to pass text contained in the underlying
 * character buffer of the scanner. The offset and length fields allow the
 * buffer to be re-used without creating new character arrays.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Methods that are passed an XMLString structure
 * should consider the contents read-only and not make any modifications
 * to the contents of the buffer. The method receiving this structure
 * should also not modify the offset and length if this structure (or
 * the values of this structure) are passed to another method.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Methods that are passed an XMLString structure
 * are required to copy the information out of the buffer if it is to be
 * saved for use beyond the scope of the method. The contents of the 
 * structure are volatile and the contents of the character buffer cannot
 * be assured once the method that is passed this structure returns.
 * Therefore, methods passed this structure should not save any reference
 * to the structure or the character array contained in the structure.
