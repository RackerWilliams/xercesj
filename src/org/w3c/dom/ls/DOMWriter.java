/**
 * <strong>DOM Level 3 WD Experimental:
 * The DOM Level 3 specification is at the stage 
 * of Working Draft, which represents work in 
 * progress and thus may be updated, replaced, 
 * or obsoleted by other documents at any time.</strong> <p>
 *  <code>DOMWriter</code> provides an API for serializing (writing) a DOM 
 * document out in an XML document. The XML data is written to an output 
 * stream, the type of which depends on the specific language bindings in 
 * use. 
 * <p> During serialization of XML data, namespace fixup is done when possible 
 * as defined in [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20020114'>DOM Level 3 Core</a>], Appendix B. [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113'>DOM Level 2 Core</a>] allows empty strings as a real namespace 
 * URI. If the <code>namespaceURI</code> of a <code>Node</code> is empty 
 * string, the serialization will treat them as <code>null</code>, ignoring 
 * the prefix if any. should the remark on DOM Level 2 namespace URI 
 * included in the namespace algorithm in Core instead?
 * <p> <code>DOMWriter</code> accepts any node type for serialization. For 
 * nodes of type <code>Document</code> or <code>Entity</code>, well formed 
 * XML will be created if possible. The serialized output for these node 
 * types is either as a Document or an External Entity, respectively, and is 
 * acceptable input for an XML parser. For all other types of nodes the 
 * serialized form is not specified, but should be something useful to a 
 * human for debugging or diagnostic purposes. Note: rigorously designing an 
 * external (source) form for stand-alone node types that don't already have 
 * one defined in [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006'>XML 1.0</a>] seems a bit much to take on here. 
 * <p>Within a <code>Document</code>, <code>DocumentFragment</code>, or 
 * <code>Entity</code> being serialized, <code>Nodes</code> are processed as 
 * follows <code>Document</code> nodes are written including with the XML 
 * declaration and a DTD subset, if one exists in the DOM. Writing a 
 * <code>Document</code> node serializes the entire document.  
 * <code>Entity</code> nodes, when written directly by 
 * <code>DOMWriter.writeNode</code>, output the entity expansion but no 
 * namespace fixup is done. The resulting output will be valid as an 
 * external entity.  <code>EntityReference</code> nodes are serialized as an 
 * entity reference of the form "<code>&amp;entityName;</code>" in the 
 * output. Child nodes (the expansion) of the entity reference are ignored.  
 * CDATA sections containing content characters that can not be represented 
 * in the specified output encoding are handled according to the 
 * "split-cdata-sections" boolean parameter.  If the boolean parameter is 
 * <code>true</code>, CDATA sections are split, and the unrepresentable 
 * characters are serialized as numeric character references in ordinary 
 * content. The exact position and number of splits is not specified.  If 
 * the boolean parameter is <code>false</code>, unrepresentable characters 
 * in a CDATA section are reported as errors. The error is not recoverable - 
 * there is no mechanism for supplying alternative characters and continuing 
 * with the serialization.  <code>DocumentFragment</code> nodes are 
 * serialized by serializing the children of the document fragment in the 
 * order they appear in the document fragment.  All other node types 
 * (Element, Text, etc.) are serialized to their corresponding XML source 
 * form.  The serialization of a <code>Node</code> does not always generate 
 * a well-formed XML document, i.e. a <code>DOMBuilder</code> might through 
 * fatal errors when parsing the resulting serialization. 
 * <p> Within the character data of a document (outside of markup), any 
 * characters that cannot be represented directly are replaced with 
 * character references. Occurrences of '&lt;' and '&amp;' are replaced by 
 * the predefined entities &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;. The other predefined 
 * entities (&amp;gt, &amp;apos, and &amp;quot;) are not used; these 
 * characters can be included directly. Any character that can not be 
 * represented directly in the output character encoding is serialized as a 
 * numeric character reference. 
 * <p> Attributes not containing quotes are serialized in quotes. Attributes 
 * containing quotes but no apostrophes are serialized in apostrophes 
 * (single quotes). Attributes containing both forms of quotes are 
 * serialized in quotes, with quotes within the value represented by the 
 * predefined entity &amp;quot;. Any character that can not be represented 
 * directly in the output character encoding is serialized as a numeric 
 * character reference. 
 * <p> Within markup, but outside of attributes, any occurrence of a character 
 * that cannot be represented in the output character encoding is reported 
 * as an error. An example would be serializing the element 
 * &lt;LaCañada/&gt; with <code>encoding="us-ascii"</code>. 
 * <p> When requested by setting the <code>normalize-characters</code> boolean 
 * parameter on <code>DOMWriter</code>, all data to be serialized, both 
 * markup and character data, is W3C Text normalized according to the rules 
 * defined in [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-charmod-20020430'>CharModel</a>]. The W3C Text normalization process affects only the data as 
 * it is being written; it does not alter the DOM's view of the document 
 * after serialization has completed. 
 * <p> Namespaces are fixed up during serialization, the serialization process 
 * will verify that namespace declarations, namespace prefixes and the 
 * namespace URIs associated with elements and attributes are consistent. If 
 * inconsistencies are found, the serialized form of the document will be 
 * altered to remove them. The method used for doing the namespace fixup 
 * while serializing a document is the algorithm defined in Appendix B.1 
 * "Namespace normalization" of [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20020114'>DOM Level 3 Core</a>]. previous paragraph to be defined closer 
 * here.
 * <p>Any changes made affect only the namespace prefixes and declarations 
 * appearing in the serialized data. The DOM's view of the document is not 
 * altered by the serialization operation, and does not reflect any changes 
 * made to namespace declarations or prefixes in the serialized output. 
 * <p> While serializing a document the serializer will write out 
 * non-specified values (such as attributes whose <code>specified</code> is 
 * <code>false</code>) if the <code>discard-default-content</code> boolean 
 * parameter is set to <code>true</code>. If the 
 * <code>discard-default-content</code> flag is set to <code>false</code> 
 * and a schema is used for validation, the schema will be also used to 
 * determine if a value is specified or not. If no schema is used, the 
 * <code>specified</code> flag on attribute nodes is used to determine if 
 * attribute values should be written out. 
 * <p> Ref to Core spec (1.1.9, XML namespaces, 5th paragraph) entity ref 
 * description about warning about unbound entity refs. Entity refs are 
 * always serialized as <code>&amp;foo;</code>, also mention this in the 
 * load part of this spec. 
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20021022'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save Specification</a>.
