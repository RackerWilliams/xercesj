This is the Status file for the Xerces for Java code base. 

There are lots of things that need to be done: 

Here are some things at the top of my list (in no particular order):

* Binary build for v1.0.2

* Additional Support for W3C XML schema.  There's both the structures
  spec and the datatypes spec.  There's a lot of work to do in the
  structures area, and that's the area I'll be working on for the next
  while.  There's also a lot of work to be done in the datatypes area,
  and this would be a great place for someone to jump and get involved
  in the code.

* Support for the DOM Level 2 ranges spec.  Ralf Pfeiffer is looking
  at this <DONE>

* Reconciling the error messages between the C++ and Java versions of
  Xerces. 

* Figuring out what support for DTD access should look like.  This
  version of Xerces supports access to the DTD via a special node in
  the DOM tree.  There's also room for a more programmatic API to the
  DTD / Schema.  This is a meaty one.

* Enabling support for a DTD Caching mechanism.  This would be
  especially beneficial in a server environment 

* There's a bunch of work that needs to be done on the DOM
  implementation.  There's a bunch of memory consumption work that
  could be done. Andy Clark is looking at this. <DONE> [Q] Can more
  be done?

* Revalidation architecture work

* DOM Write validation

* Incorporation of features and improvements from other technology
  contributions. 
  
  The first one is the printers proposal from Assaf Arkin. <DONE>
 
* refinement and extension of the incremental parsing API

* scripts to build parser subconfigurations

* additional configuration options.

* performance, performance, performance.

* conformance, conformance, conformance.

* a bunch of things that haven't been thought of yet.

* more documentation

* more samples

* kill bugs

* Major work on the build system.
  
  ANT vs Makefiles is the current discussion

* Hook up JavaScript DOM API tests (see http://www.nist.gov/xml)

* JAXP Wrappers for Xerces
  pending resolution of licensing issues
